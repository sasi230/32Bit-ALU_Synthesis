## Exp:5 32 Bit ALU-Synthesize the Gate Level Netlist and tabulate Area and Power reports..(Using Genus in Cadence)

## Aim:

Synthesize 32 Bit ALU design using Constraints and analyse area and Power reports.

## Tool Required:

Functional Simulation: Incisive Simulator (ncvlog, ncelab, ncsim)

Synthesis: Genus

## Step 1: Getting Started

Synthesis requires three files as follows,

◦ Liberty Files (.lib)

◦ Verilog/VHDL Files (.v or .vhdl or .vhd)

## Step 2 : Performing Synthesis

The Liberty files are present in the library path,

• The Available technology nodes are 180nm ,90nm and 45nm.

• In the terminal, initialise the tools with the following commands if a new terminal is being
used.

◦ csh

◦ source /cadence/install/cshrc

• The tool used for Synthesis is “Genus”. Hence, type “genus -gui” to open the tool.

• Genus Script file with .tcl file Extension commands are executed one by one to synthesize the netlist.

## Result: 
The generic netlist of 32 bit ALU  has been created, and area, power reports have been tabulated and generated using Genus.
